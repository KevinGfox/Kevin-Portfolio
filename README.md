# PROJECT 1 : Walmar

This project goal is to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in Walmart stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help Walmart's marketing services understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

# PROJECT 2 : Disaster tweets

NLP competition on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started
> I used deep learning models to classify tweets.
