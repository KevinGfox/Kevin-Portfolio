# [PROJECT 1 : Linear regression model to predict walmart sales](https://github.com/KevinGfox/Walmart-project)
This project goal is to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in Walmart stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help Walmart's marketing services understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

The project can be divided into three steps:

- Part 1 : Make an EDA and all the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for machine learning 
- Part 2 : Train a linear regression model (baseline) 
- Part 3 : Avoid overfitting by training a regularized regression model

# [PROJECT 2 : Exploratory data analysis on speedating](https://github.com/KevinGfox/Certification/tree/main/bloc2)
competition on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment
The goal is to understand what happens during a speed dating and especially to understand what will influence the obtaining of a second date.
I realised and EDA with a feature selection to understand the influence of age and races on getting a second date.

# [PROJECT 3 : Data collection and managment with KAYAK](https://github.com/KevinGfox/Certification/tree/main/bloc1)
The marketing team needs help on a new project. After doing some user research, the team discovered that 70% of their users who are planning a trip would like to have more information about the destination they are going to.

In addition, user research shows that people tend to be defiant about the information they are reading if they don't know the brand which produced the content.

Therefore, Kayak Marketing Team would like to create an application that will recommend where people should plan their next holidays. The application should be based on real data about:
- Weather
- Hotels in the area
The application should then be able to recommend the best destinations and hotels based on the above variables at any given time.

Goals of this project:
> Scrape data from destinations
> Get weather data from each destination
> Get hotels' info about each destination
> Store all the information above in a data lake
> Extract, transform and load cleaned data from your datalake to a data warehouse

# [PROJECT 4 : Deep learning models to classify tweets](https://github.com/KevinGfox/Disaster-Tweets)
NLP competition on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started
> I used deep learning models to classify tweets. 
The project can be divided into three steps:

- Part 1 : Make an EDA
- Part 2 : Make the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for deep learning models
- Part 3 : Train two models and identify the early stoping point

# [PROJECT 5 : Deploy EDA analysis with app framework Streamlit and deploy API](https://github.com/KevinGfox/Certification/tree/main/bloc5)
When using Getaround, drivers book cars for a specific time period, from an hour to a few days long. They are supposed to bring back the car on time, but it happens from time to time that drivers are late for the checkout.

Late returns at checkout can generate high friction for the next driver if the car was supposed to be rented again on the same day : Customer service often reports users unsatisfied because they had to wait for the car to come back from the previous rental or users that even had to cancel their rental because the car wasn’t returned on time.

In order to mitigate those issues we’ve decided to implement a minimum delay between two rentals. A car won’t be displayed in the search results if the requested checkin or checkout times are too close from an already booked rental.
It solves the late checkout issue but also potentially hurts Getaround/owners revenues: we need to find the right trade off.

Our Product Manager still needs to decide:

- threshold: how long should the minimum delay be?
- scope: should we enable the feature for all cars?, only Connect cars?

In order to help them make the right decision, they are asking you for some data insights. Here are the first analyses they could think of, to kickstart the discussion. Don’t hesitate to perform additional analysis that you find relevant.

> Which share of our owner’s revenue would potentially be affected by the feature?
> How many rentals would be affected by the feature depending on the threshold and scope we choose?
> How often are drivers late for the next check-in? How does it impact the next driver?
> How many problematic cases will it solve depending on the chosen threshold and scope?

1) Build a dashboard that will help the product Management team with the above questions
2) Create and API indicating the optimum rental price using custom model and AWS cloud services

# [PROJECT 6 : Random music generation app](https://github.com/KevinGfox/Certification/tree/main/bloc6)
This is a team project application which generate random music. 
We used MAGENTA library (https://github.com/magenta/magenta) to create the app.
