# [PROJECT 1 : Linear regression model to predict walmart sales](https://github.com/KevinGfox/Walmart-project)
This project goal is to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in Walmart stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help Walmart's marketing services understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

The project can be divided into three steps:

Part 1 : make an EDA and all the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for machine learning 
Part 2 : train a linear regression model (baseline) 
Part 3 : avoid overfitting by training a regularized regression model

# [PROJECT 4 : Deep learning models to classify tweets](https://github.com/KevinGfox/Disaster-Tweets)
NLp competition on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started
> I used deep learning models to classify tweets. 
The project can be divided into three steps:

- Part 1 : Make an EDA
- Part 2 : Make the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for deep learning models
- Part 3 : Train two models and identify the early stoping point
