# [PROJECT 1 : Deploy an EDA with app framework Streamlit and deploy an API](https://github.com/KevinGfox/Certification/tree/main/bloc5)
Getaround is an online car sharing or peer-to-peer carsharing service that connects drivers who need to reserve cars with car owners who share their cars in exchange for payment.
The project is divided in two parts. the first part is an exploratory data analysis to understand the importance of canceled rentals. The second part is to create a custom model indicating the optimum rental price to users. 
Goals of this project:
> Build an EDA dashboards with Streamlit and deploy it with Docker & Heroku

> Create and API using the model connected with AWS & MLflow and deploy it with Docker & Heroku

Libraries : Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, Scikit-learn, FastAPI, Streamlit, Uvicorn, Mlflow

# [PROJECT 2 : Random music generation app](https://github.com/KevinGfox/Certification/tree/main/bloc6)
This is a team project application which generate random music with a tuned variational autoencoder model.
We used MAGENTA library (https://github.com/magenta/magenta) to create the app.

Libraries : Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow, Magenta, midi2audio, Pyfluidsynth, PIL

# [PROJECT 3 : Exploratory data analysis on speedating](https://github.com/KevinGfox/Certification/tree/main/bloc2)
competition on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment
The goal is to understand what happens during a speed dating and especially to understand what will influence the obtaining of a second date.
I realised and EDA with a feature selection to understand the influence of age and races on getting a second date.

Libraries : Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Plotly

# [PROJECT 4 : Data collection and managment with KAYAK](https://github.com/KevinGfox/Certification/tree/main/bloc1)
This project is a composed with two different data collection (web scrapping of booking.com and an API request of openweathermap.org) and ETL process to create animated graphics with both selected weather and hotels data. Goals of this project:

> Get weather data from each destination (Temperature, Rainfall, Winforce)

> Get hotel's info about each destination (Hotel description, Ratings, GPS)

> Store all the information above in a data lake (AWS - S3)

> Extract, transform and load cleaned data to a data warehouse (AWS - RDS)

> Create animated framed graphics

Libraries : Pandas, Plotly, Scrapy, Boto3, SQLalchemy

# [PROJECT 5 : Deep learning models to classify tweets](https://github.com/KevinGfox/Certification/tree/main/bloc4)
NLP competition on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started
> I used deep learning models to classify tweets. 
The project can be divided into three steps:

- Part 1 : Make an EDA
- Part 2 : Make the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for deep learning models
- Part 3 : Train two models and identify the early stoping point

Libraries : Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Spacy, Tensorflow

# [PROJECT 6 : Linear regression model to predict walmart sales](https://github.com/KevinGfox/Certification/tree/main/bloc3)
This project goal is to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in Walmart stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help Walmart's marketing services understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

The project can be divided into three steps:

- Part 1 : Make an EDA and all the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for machine learning 
- Part 2 : Train a linear regression model (baseline) 
- Part 3 : Avoid overfitting by training a regularized regression model

Libraries : Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Plotly
